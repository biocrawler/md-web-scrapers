We can observe relaxation dynamics and fluctuations of the dimeric protease over the microseconds timescale. We hope that this raw data can help drug development efforts targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Preparation details and summaries will be submitted to ""Data in Brief"".

The inhibitor-SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex models were placed in the orthorhombic box with a buffer distance of 10 Å in order to create a hydration model. TIP3P water model was used for creation of the hydration model. We performed MD simulations under the NPT ensemble for 1 μs on three complex structures using OPLS3e force field. 	10.17632/5jfsx6j75g.2	Drug|Coronavirus Disease 2019|Molecular Dynamics|Molecular Docking|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2		Drug|Coronavirus Disease 2019|Molecular Dynamics|Molecular Docking|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2		2020-04-21	MENDELEY_DATA	Trajectory data of molecular dynamics simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease and inhibitor drug candidates	article	2.0

Additionally, we present OPLS-AA molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories for alanine (ALA), leucine (LEU), glutamine (GLN), and tyrosine (TYR) varying the values of major force field parameters: charge on all amino acid atoms, bond length (all amino acid bonds), Lennard-Jones epsilon parameter and stiffness of bond angles. Our data enable to uncover sensitivity of molecular dynamics derived analysis to variation of force field and water models and force field parameters. This data set was used to understand the effect of molecular dynamics parameters on dielectric properties of amino acid solutions.	10.5281/zenodo.3352030	Dielectric spectroscopy|Amino acid|Molecular dynamics|Force field|Biomolecules		Dielectric spectroscopy|Amino acid|Molecular dynamics|Force field|Biomolecules		2019-07-31	ZENODO	Dataset A1606 and A1905	article

Simulations have been performed using the SIRAH force field running with the Amber18 package at the Uruguayan National Center for Supercomputing (ClusterUY) under the conditions reported in Machado et al. JCTC 2019, adding 150 mM NaCl according to Machado & Pantano JCTC 2020. 

The files 6LU7_SIRAHcg_rawdata1.tar,  6LU7_SIRAHcg_rawdata2.tar, and 6LU7_SIRAHcg_rawdata3.tar, contain all the raw information required to visualize (on VMD), analyze, backmap, and eventually continue the simulations using Amber18 or higher. Step-By-Step tutorials for running, visualizing, and analyzing CG trajectories using SirahTools can be found at www.sirahff.com.

Additionally, the file 6LU7_SIRAHcg_10us_prot.tar contains only the protein coordinates, while 6LU7_SIRAHcg_10us_prot_skip10ns.tar contains one frame every 10ns.

To take a quick look at the trajectory:

1- Untar the file 6LU7_SIRAHcg_10us_prot_skip10ns.tar

2- Open the trajectory on VMD using the command line:

vmd6LU7_SIRAHcg_prot.prmtop 6LU7_SIRAHcg_prot_15us_skip10ns.ncrst 6LU7_SIRAHcg_prot_15us_skip10ns.nc -e sirah_vmdtk.tcl

Note that you can use normal VMD drawing methods as vdw, licorice, etc., and coloring by restype, element, name, etc.

These evolutionary shifts depend upon modifications of the developmental processes which direct growth and morphogenesis. Here we examine the evolution of cranial ontogenetic trajectories to shed light on the mechanisms underlying convergent snout evolution. We use geometric morphometrics to quantify skeletogenesis in an evolutionary context and reconstruct ancestral patterns of ontogenetic allometry to understand the developmental drivers of craniofacial diversity within Crocodylia. Our analyses uncovered a conserved embryonic region of morphospace (CER) shared by all non-gavialid crocodylians regardless of their eventual adult ecomorph. This observation suggests the presence of conserved developmental processes during early development (before Ferguson stage 20) across most of Crocodylia. Ancestral state reconstruction of ontogenetic trajectories revealed heterochrony, developmental constraint, and developmental systems drift have all played essential roles in the evolution of ecomorphs. Based on these observations, we conclude that two separate, but interconnected, developmental programs controlling craniofacial morphogenesis and growth enabled the evolutionary plasticity of skull shape in crocodylians.	10.5061/dryad.6cv82g1	evolutionary developmental biology|skull|heterochrony|geometric morphometrics|embryonic ontogeny		Crocodylia		2019-01-29	DRYAD	Data from: Heterochronic shifts and conserved embryonic shape underlie crocodylian craniofacial disparity and convergence
