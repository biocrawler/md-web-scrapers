We can observe relaxation dynamics and fluctuations of the dimeric protease over the microseconds timescale. We hope that this raw data can help drug development efforts targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Preparation details and summaries will be submitted to ""Data in Brief"".

To accelerate the discovery of PPAR α/γ dual agonists, the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) were performed for PPARα and PPARγ, respectively. Based on the molecular alignment, highly predictive CoMFA model for PPARα was obtained with a cross-validated q2 value of 0.741 and a conventional r2 of 0.975 in the non-cross-validated partial least-squares (PLS) analysis, while the CoMFA model for PPARγ with a better predictive ability was shown with q2 and r2 values of 0.557 and 0.996, respectively. Contour maps derived from the 3D-QSAR models provided information on main factors towards the activity. Then, we carried out structural optimization and designed several new compounds to improve the predicted biological activity. To investigate the binding modes of the predicted compounds in the active site of PPARα/γ, a molecular docking simulation was carried out. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicated that the predicted ligands were stable in the active site of PPARα/γ. Therefore, combination of the CoMFA and structure-based drug design results could be used for further structural alteration and synthesis and development of novel and potent dual agonists.

Currently, no vaccines or standard therapy is avaliable to treate DENV infection. This makes the drug development against DENV more significant and challenging. The MTase domain of DENV RNA RdRp NS5 is a promising drug target, because this domain hosts the RNA capping process of DENV RNA to escape from human immune system. In the present study, we have analysed the RNA intervention mechanism exerted by flavoniod molecules against NS5 MTase RNA capping site by using molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and the binding free energy calculations. The results from the docking analysis confirmed that the RNA intervention mecanism is exerted by the quercetagetin (QGN) molecule with all necessary intermolecular interactions and high binding affinity. Notably, QGN forms strong hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn18, Leu20 and Ser150 residues and π⋅⋅⋅π stacking interaction with Phe25 residue. The apo and QGN bound NS5 MTase and QGN-NS5 MTase complex were used for MD simulation. The results of MD simulation reveal that the RMSD and RMSF values of QGN-MTase complex have increased on comparing the apo protein due to the effect of ligand binding. The binding free energy calulation includes prediction of total binding free energy of ligand-protein complex and per-residue free energy decomposition. The QGN binding to NS5 MTase affects it’s native motion, this result is found from Principal component analysis. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

SARS is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). In the present study, we have designed two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), helper T lymphocyte (HTL) and B cell epitopes overlap, bearing the potential to elicit cellular as well as humoral immune response. We have used truncated (residues 10–153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 as molecular adjuvants at N-terminal of both the MEVs. Selected overlapping epitopes of both the MEVs were further validated for stable molecular interactions with their respective human leukocyte antigen class I and II allele binders. Moreover, CTL epitopes were further studied for their molecular interaction with transporter associated with antigen processing. Furthermore, after tertiary structure modelling, both the MEVs were validated for their stable molecular interaction with Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs was analysed for their potential high level of expression in the mammalian cell line (Human) needed for their further in vivo testing. Overall, the present study proposes in silico validated design of two MEVs against SARS composed of specific epitopes with the potential to cause a high level of SARS-CoV specific cellular as well as humoral immune response.

The layered nature of these perovskites offers an exciting possibility of harnessing their ferroelectric property for photovoltaics. Adjacent polar domains in a ferroelectric material allow the spatial separation of electrons and holes. Presently, the structure-function properties governing the ferroelectric behavior of RP perovskites are an open question. Herein, we realize tunable ferroelectricity in 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA) and methylammonium (MA) RP perovskite (PEA)2(MA)n̄-1Pbn̄I3n̄+1. Second harmonic generation confirms the non-centrosymmetric nature of these poly-crystalline thin films; while piezo force microscopy and polarization-electric field measurements validate the microscopic and macroscopic ferroelectric properties. Temperature dependent SHG and dielectric constant measurements uncover a phase transition temperature at around 170 °C in these films. Extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations support the experimental results and identified correlated reorientation of MA molecules and ion translations as the source of ferroelectricity. Current-voltage characteristics in the dark reveal the persistence of hysteresis in these devices, which has profound implications for light harvesting and light emitting applications. Importantly, our findings disclose a viable approach for engineering the ferroelectric properties of RP perovskites that may unlock new functionalities for perovskite optoelectronics.	10.21979/n9/piigck					2019-01-01	gdcc.ntu	Replication Data for: Tunable Ferroelectricity in Ruddlesden-Popper Halide Perovskites

Recent studies reported lymphocytopenia but also expansions of antigen-specific T/B cells during early-recovery stage. Here we investigated 16 early-recovery patients using scRNA-seq, HLA-genotyping and deep immune repertoire profling. Our analysis revealed 916 COVID-19-specific TCR groups enriched for a novel cytotoxic CD8+ phenotype with both resident memory (ZNF683+) and tissue exit (SIRP5) markers, and identified 114 statistically-confident virus epitopes. Further, we uncovered 374 BCR groups with somatic hypermutations and/or class switch recombinations. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed 15% of the highly expanded groups may serve as neutralizing antibodies against the virus Spike protein. Finally, we discovered that bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients may elevate monocytic myeloidderived suppressor cells via TLR4/NF!B signaling and cause disease aggravation. Together, we expect our findings and immune-receptor datasets to provide immediate therapeutic options against the pandemic of COVID-19.	10.5281/zenodo.3744141	COVID-19|Single cell sequencing|Immune repertoire profiling		COVID-19|Single cell sequencing|Immune repertoire profiling		2020-04-08	ZENODO	Single cell and immune repertoire profiling of COVID-19 patients reveal novel therapeutic candidates	article

The system is built as a pyramid of increasing complexity, with two E1 (ubiquitin activating), few dozen E2 (ubiquitin conjugating) and several hundred E3 (ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. By collecting and analyzing E3 sequences from the KEGG BRITE database and literature, we assembled a coherent dataset of 563 human E3s and analyzed their various physical features. We found an increase in structural disorder of the system with multiple disorder predictors (IUPred – E1: 5.97%, E2: 17.74%, E3: 20.03%). E3s that can bind E2 and substrate simultaneously (single subunit E3, ssE3) have significantly higher disorder (22.98%) than E3s in which E2 binding (multi RING-finger, mRF, 0.62%), scaffolding (6.01%) and substrate binding (adaptor/substrate recognition subunits, 17.33%) functions are separated. In ssE3s, the disorder was localized in the substrate/adaptor binding domains, whereas the E2-binding RING/HECT-domains were structured. To demonstrate the involvement of disorder in E3 function, we applied normal modes and molecular dynamics analyses to show how a disordered and highly flexible linker in human CBL (an E3 that acts as a regulator of several tyrosine kinase-mediated signalling pathways) facilitates long-range conformational changes bringing substrate and E2-binding domains towards each other and thus assisting in ubiquitin transfer. E3s with multiple interaction partners (as evidenced by data in STRING) also possess elevated levels of disorder (hubs, 22.90% vs. non-hubs, 18.36%). Furthermore, a search in PDB uncovered 21 distinct human E3 interactions, in 7 of which the disordered region of E3s undergoes induced folding (or mutual induced folding) in the presence of the partner. In conclusion, our data highlights the primary role of structural disorder in the functions of E3 ligases that manifests itself in the substrate/adaptor binding functions as well as the mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by long-range conformational transitions.	10.5061/dryad.84kj5		VIB Department of Structural Biology|Institute of Enzymology|Vrije Universiteit Brussel|Hungarian Academy of Sciences|Research Centre for Natural Sciences			2016-04-26	DRYAD	Data from: Functional diversity and structural disorder in the human ubiquitination pathway

It has long been assumed that RNA or DNA base pairs are broken by the concerted symmetric movement of complementary nucleobases. By analyzing thousands of base-pair opening and closing events from molecular simulations, here we uncover a systematic stepwiseprocessdrivenbytheasymmetricﬂipping-outprobability of paired nucleobases. We demonstrate experimentally that such asymmetry strongly biases the unwinding efﬁciency of DNA helicases towards substrates that bear highly-dynamic nucleobases, such as pyrimidines, on the displaced strand.

57		Knott, Simon Robert Vincent	https://doi.org/10.25549%2Fusctheses-m3931	DATASET		Restricted until 09 Nov. 2011. For cells to proliferate, the genome must be replicated exactly once per cell cycle in a timely and accurate manner. Making this task difficult are multiple other genomic processes, such as transcription and DNA repair, that are concurrently operating on the same genomic template. Replication initiates at specific loci called replication origins that must undergo a series of protein loadings before they can begin to replicate. Although this loading schedule takes place at all origins, individual origins fire at distinct and conserved times during S-phase.   It has been suggested that origin firing schedules are defined by their propensity to attract rate limiting replication factors from limited pools (where origins with higher propensities replicate earlier and origins with lower propensities replicate later). This model has not been validated and, furthermore, the factors determining an origin's propensity to attract replication factors remains poorly understood. In higher eukaryotes, replication timing has been linked to epigenetic inheritance and genomic stability. Thus, determining which factors dictate origin timing schedules is important for understanding the mechanisms driving development and healthy cell proliferation.; This current work investigates the molecular kinetics that drive the S. cerevisiae replication schedule and also begins to uncover what coordination they exhibit with concurrently operating genomic processes. To understand better these timing dynamics, we begin by developing molecular and computational tools to analyze replication timing genome-wide. Using these tools we produce a novel dataset that represents the highest fidelity temporal map of DNA replication to date. Next, to identify novel candidate limiting factors to DNA replication, we describe and analyze (in the context of this temporal map) two additional datasets designed to capture both pre-S-phase replication protein loading and global origin efficiencies.; Through analysis of these data we determine that, in G1-phase, the earliest replicating origins show a high propensity to attract Cdc45 (a replication factor that is limited in its nuclear concentration G1-phase). Following this, we devise and computationally implement a detailed theoretical model of DNA replication to test the hypothesis that origin firing dynamics (and hence genome-wide replication times) are determined by their ability to recruit replication factors from limited pools. After validating this model we identify factors that, in unperturbed cells, are correlated with origin firing dynamics. These include nucleosome positioning around the origin and the clustering of origins in the nucleus in late G1-phase.; Previous work has demonstrated that histone acetylation around an origin promotes its early replication. Specifically, others have shown that when the histone-deacetylase Rpd3 is removed from the cell several origins increase in their activity. To test the scope of Rpd3's action at origins, we have analyzed Rpd3 mutant cells genome-wide for their origin replication activities. We determined that approximately one-third of origins are suppressed by Rpd3 action. By targeting the individual complexes that Rpd3 operates in, we determined that its action at origins is through its role in transcriptional repression at the gene promoter, as opposed to its broad action as a suppressor of spurious transcription events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regions surrounding Rpd3-regulated origns are deacetylated by Rpd3 and also that these regions are enriched for Rpd3 binding and Rpd3-regulated genes.; Finally, we introduce the forkhead transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 as two novel regulators of origin function. We demonstrate that Fkh1 alone regulates ~50 origins and that in cells where both Fkh1 and Fkh2 action is removed, over one-half of all origins show deregulation. Furthermore, these factors are the first to be identified that have both repressive and excitatory action at origins (~100 origins are activated by Fkh1 and Fkh2 while ~80 are repressed; Fkh-excited and -repressed, respectively). As mentioned above, Cdc45 association at origins in G1-phase is predictive of their function. We demonstrate that in fkh1Δfkh2Δ cells, this factor is depleted at Fkh-excited origins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Fkh-excited origins are not found near the centromere, in contrast Fkh-repressed origins include many origins that localize at the centromere. Finally, we determine that Fkh1 and Fkh2 likely have their action at origins by regulating the formation of long-range chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we show evidence suggesting (that to regulate these interactions) individual forkhead proteins bind at different origins and then dimerize to bring these origins together in the nucleus.	10.25549/usctheses-m3931	modeling|transcription|Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|replication origin|chromatin				2015-01-01	usc.dl	Measuring, modeling and identifying factors that influence eukaryotic DNA replication

Members of the P. amabilis species complex represent invaluable germplasm for the breeding program. However, the phylogeny of the P. amabilis species complex is still uncertain. The Phalaenopsis amabilis species complex (Orchidaceae) consists of subspecies amabilis, moluccana, and rosenstromii of P. amabilis, as well as P. aphrodite ssp. aphrodite, P. ap. ssp. formosana, and P. sanderiana. The aims of this study were to reconstruct the phylogeny and biogeographcial patterns of the species complex using Neighbor Joining (NJ), Maxinum Parsimony (MP), Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees (BEAST) and Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies (RASP) analyses based on sequences of internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 from the nuclear ribosomal DNA and the trnH-psbA spacer from the plastid DNA. Results: A pattern of vicariance, dispersal, and vicariance + dispersal among disjunctly distributed taxa was uncovered based on RASP analysis. Although two subspecies of P. aphrodite could not be differentiated from each other in dispersal state, they were distinct from P. amabilis and P. sanderiana. Within P. amabilis, three subspecies were separated phylogenetically, in agreement with the vicariance or vicariance + dispersal scenario, with geographic subdivision along Huxley’s, Wallace’s and Lydekker’s Lines. Molecular dating revealed such subdivisions among taxa of P. amabilis complex dating back to the late Pleistocene. Population-dynamic analyses using a Bayesian skyline plot suggested that the species complex experienced an in situ range expansion and population concentration during the late Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Conclusions: Taxa of the P. amabilis complex with disjunct distributions were differentiated due to vicariance or vicariance + dispersal, with events likely occurring in the late Pleistocene. Demographic growth associated with the climatic oscillations in the Würm glacial period followed the species splits. Nevertheless, a subsequent population slowdown occurred in the late LGM due to extinction of regional populations. The reduction of suitable habitats resulted in geographic fragmenttation of the remaining taxa.	10.5061/dryad.f8j12	species complex|biogeography|demographic dynamics|phylogeny|vicariance		Phalaenopsis  sanderiana|Phalaenopsis amabilis|Phalaenopsis aphrodite ssp. aphrodite|Phalaenopsis amabilis ssp. amabilis|Phalaenopsis aphrodite ssp. formosana|Phalaenopsis  amabilis ssp. rosenstromii|Phalaenopsis  amabilis ssp. moluccana		2015-08-27	DRYAD	Data from: Biogeography of the Phalaenopsis amabilis species complex inferred from nuclear and plastid DNAs

Motivated by computational convenience, this assumption sacrifices biological realism and offers little opportunity to uncover the temporal dynamics in evolutionary histories. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that explicitly relaxes the time-homogeneity assumption by allowing the specification of different infinitesimal substitution rate matrices across different time intervals, called epochs, along the evolutionary history. We focus on an epoch model implementation in a Bayesian inference framework that offers great modeling flexibility in drawing inference about any discrete data type characterized as a continuous-time Markov chain, including phylogeographic traits. To alleviate the computational burden that the additional temporal heterogeneity imposes, we adopt a massively parallel approach that achieves both fine- and coarse-grain parallelization of the computations across branches that accommodate epoch transitions, making extensive use of graphics processing units. Through synthetic examples, we assess model performance in recovering evolutionary parameters from data generated according to different evolutionary scenarios that comprise different numbers of epochs for both nucleotide and codon substitution processes. We illustrate the usefulness of our inference framework in two different applications to empirical data sets: the selection dynamics on within-host HIV populations throughout infection and the seasonality of global influenza circulation. In both cases, our epoch model captures key features of temporal heterogeneity that remained difficult to test using ad hoc procedures.	10.5061/dryad.qp747	Phylogeography|Phylogenetics|Epoch Model|BEAGLE|Bayesian inference|BEAST	University of California|National Institutes of Health|Departments of Biomathematics and Human Genetics|David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA|Rega Institute|UCLA Fielding School of Public Health|Department of Biostatistics|University of Edinburgh|Department of Microbiology and Immunology|Fogarty International Center|Institute of Evolutionary Biology			2014-02-28	DRYAD	Data from: Inferring heterogeneous evolutionary processes through time: from sequence substitution to phylogeography

Here we report a near-complete chromosome-scale assembly for cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and uncovered the origin and evolutionary processes that shaped this complex allopolyploid. We identified the extant relatives of each diploid progenitor species and provide support for the North American origin of octoploid strawberry. We examined the dynamics among the four subgenomes in octoploid strawberry and uncovered the presence of a single dominant subgenome with significantly greater gene content, gene expression abundance, and biased exchanges between homoeologous chromosomes, as compared with the other subgenomes. Pathway analysis showed that certain metabolomic and disease-resistance traits are largely controlled by the dominant subgenome. These findings and the reference genome should serve as a powerful platform for future evolutionary studies and enable molecular breeding in strawberry.	10.5061/dryad.b2c58pc			Fragaria x ananassa		2019-02-25	DRYAD	Data from: Origin and evolution of the octoploid strawberry genome
