120,Bug in CCFD stress profile calculation of GROMACS-LS?,"['by Miettinen, Markus S.', 'Miettinen, Markus S.', 'Miettinen, Markus S.']",['Uncategorized'],['zenodo'],"In Martini simulations (15 us, last 5 us analyzed) of an asymmetric GM1+POPC lipid bilayer (5+95 upper, 0+100 lower leaflet) strong stress fluctuations arising from the dihedral contributions of CCF decomposition are found. It is possible that these are due to a slight bug in the GROMACS-LS (http://mdstress.org) code, because:
1) The fluctuations do not show converge, when more data is added, see the attached plot ‘effect_of_sampling_rate.pdf’.
2) The fluctuations (but no other features of the stress profiles) visibly depend on the chosen frame of reference, see ‘effect_of_centering_schemes.pdf’.
3) The stress profiles calculated along the coordinates that lay in the membrane plane (x and y), are not constant in CCFD, see ‘profiles_along_x_and_y.pdf’.

Eelen et al. Nature 2018 vol. 561 (7721) pp. 63-69].

The PDB files (human.pdb and bacterial.pdb) contain representative structures extracted from the molecular dynamics simulations of the S. Typhimurium (bacterial.pdb) and Human Glutamine Synthetase (human.pdb). For the latter, models of the two most relevant binding modes of Palmitoyl-CoA are included in the file.

The trajectories included are the FINAL 450 ns of 2 fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Glutamine Synthetase (GS) performed with GROMACS and the Amber ff14SB force field. The Human_GS.x is the trajectory of human GS (reference PDB 2OJW) with Palmitoyl-CoA. In this trajecory the palmitate tail points upwards (which was the most interesting orientation found).
""Bacterial_GS"" is the bacterial GS trajectory (reference starting PDB 1FPY) with Palmitoyl-CoA - palmitate tail points downwards. The trajectories are in GROMACS trr format and have been saved every 200ps.

Like TrR, AhpF employs tightly bound FAD and redox-active disulfide center(s) in catalyzing electron transfer from reduced pyridine nucleotides to the disulfide bond of its protein substrate. Homology of AhpF to the smaller (35 kDa) TrR protein occurs in the C-terminal part of AhpF; a stretch of about 200 amino acids at the N-terminus of AhpF contains an additional redox-active disulfide center and is required for catalysis of AhpC reduction. We have demonstrated that fusion of the N-terminal 207 amino acids of AhpF to full-length TrR results in a chimeric protein (Nt-TrR) with essentially the same catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) as AhpF in AhpC reductase assays; both kcat and the Km for AhpC are decreased about 3−4-fold for Nt-TrR compared with AhpF. In addition, Nt-TrR retains essentially full TrR activity. Based on results from two mutants of Nt-TrR (C129,132S and C342,345S), AhpC reductase activity requires both centers while TrR activity requires only the C-terminal-most disulfide center in Nt-TrR. The high catalytic efficiency with which Nt-TrR can reduce thioredoxin implies that the attached N-terminal domain does not block access of thioredoxin to the TrR-derived Cys342−Cys345 center of Nt-TrR nor does it impede the putative conformational changes that this part of Nt-TrR is proposed to undergo during catalysis. These studies indicate that the C-terminal part of AhpF and bacterial TrR have very similar mechanistic properties. These findings also confirm that the N-terminal domain of AhpF plays a direct role in AhpC reduction.",.trr,,,,,,,,,

(B) An equal 50% increase in wall expansion in kidney and lung arteries would cause marked differences in TRR and TC increases, while TMV would only increase mildly and remain comparable between the two organs.

In 2015, the German Research Foundation followed suit and aligned its ‘Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data’ (DFG, 2015) with these ‘Principles’. In accordance with DFG’s ‘Guidelines’, the collaborative research center TRR 170 (Late Accretion to Terrestrial Planets) has adopted a policy how to manage long-term archiving and accessibility of its research data.
Research data generated in TRR 170 subprojects are diverse reflecting the range of methods used, including laboratory and other instrumental data on planetary samples, remote sensing data, geological maps and model simulations. Accordingly, the strong interdisciplinary alignment of the TRR 170 research network comprises heterogeneous data and different data formats.
During the first funding period, we built a file management and database system, TRR 170-DB, to manage data of TRR 170. TRR 170-DB is operated on the open source data management software Dataverse and can be accessed via a web portal, the Planetary Data Portal. TRR170-DB and Dataverse’s functionalities ensure that each step in the data lifecycle of research data is met. The Planetary Data Portal is hosted on a VM server and provides storage for published and unpublished TRR 170 data for access within the TRR 170 network. We use up-to-date programming standards and languages (JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, SQL) to customize interactions between users and TRR 170-DB. The file management and database software Dataverse provides standard-compliant metadata to ensure that metadata can be mapped easily to several standard metadata schemas (Dublin Core, Worldmap, DDI, VO, etc.).
Research data stored in TRR170-DB can take advantage of a Dataverse functionality that provides digital object identifiers (DOI) through DataCite services. DOI assigned research data are traceable and thus facilitates reproducible research.
The landscape of repositories in the planetary sciences is highly fragmented and dispersed between different scientific disciplines. A key aspect of the future development of the Planetary Data Portal is to bring together data and relevant information from different planetary communities. The Planetary Data Portal will serve as a single access point to various communities, including planetary sample data and experimental studies, planetary missions, geophysical modeling and astrophysics/astronomy.",.trr,,,,,,,,,

In a LIB, TRR is packaged separately and released when internal shorting happens, so as to suppress exothermic reactions and slow down temperature increase. THA is identified as the most efficient TRR. Upon nail penetration, 4 wt % THA can reduce the peak temperature by nearly 50%. The working mechanisms of the three amines are different: THA is highly wettable to the separator and immiscible with the electrolyte, and therefore, it blocks lithium-ion (Li+) transport. BA and DBA decrease the ionic conductivity of electrolyte and increase the charge transfer resistance. All three amines react with charged electrodes; the reactions of DBA and THA do not have much influence on the overall heat generation, while the reaction of BA cannot be ignored.",.trr,,,,,,,,,

Ellis', 'Yiqing Guo', 'Yiqing Guo', 'Xiangmei Chen', 'Xiangmei Chen', 'Ronald E. Ellis', 'Ronald E. Ellis']",['Biological Sciences'],"['bipotential', 'shaped', 'hermaphroditic']","A subset of transcription factors like Gli2 and Oct1 are bipotential — they can activate or repress the same target, in response to changing signals from upstream genes. Some previous studies implied that the sex-determination protein TRA-1 might also be bipotential; here we confirm this hypothesis by identifying a co-factor, and use it to explore how the structure of a bipotential switch changes during evolution. First, null mutants reveal that C. briggsae TRR-1 is required for spermatogenesis, RNA interference implies that it works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex, and RT-PCR data show that it promotes the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. Second, epistasis tests reveal that TRR-1 works through TRA-1, both to activate Cbr-fog-3 and to control the sperm/oocyte decision. Since previous studies showed that TRA-1 can repress fog-3 as well, these observations demonstrate that it is bipotential. Third, TRR-1 also regulates the development of the male tail. Since Cbr-tra-2 Cbr-trr-1 double mutants resemble Cbr-tra-1 null mutants, these two regulatory branches control all tra-1 activity. Fourth, striking differences in the relationship between these two branches of the switch have arisen during recent evolution. C. briggsae trr-1 null mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, but not Cbr-fem null mutants, which disrupt the other half of the switch. On the other hand, C. elegans fem null mutants prevent spermatogenesis, but not Cel-trr-1 mutants. However, synthetic interactions confirm that both halves of the switch exist in each species. Thus, the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution, so that the same phenotype is produce by alternative, complementary mechanisms.",.trr,,,,,,,,,

In the ancestral species, the fog-3 gene is inactive in XX larvae because TRA-1 repressing activity outweighs its activating activity. In C. elegans, fog-3 is expressed because increased FEM activity lowers the amount of TRA-1 repressor in the larval germ line. By contrast, in C. briggsae, fog-3 is expressed because of an increase in TRA-1 activating function. C–H. Models for how mutations in C. briggsae and C. elegans affect the expression of fog-3 in larval hermaphrodites. The key factors are that the expression of fog-3 is determined by a competition between TRA-1 activating and repressing activities, that in the complete absence of TRA-1, fog-3 will be transcribed, and that in C. elegans either maternal TRR-1 activity, or an unknown chromatin regulator, allows for spermatogenesis in trr-1 mutants.

In addition to EHMT1 mutations, de novo variants were reported in four additional genes (MBD5, SMARCB1, NR1I3, and KMT2C), in single individuals with clinical characteristics overlapping Kleefstra syndrome. Here, we present a novel cohort of five patients with de novo loss of function mutations affecting the histone methyltransferase KMT2C. Our clinical data delineates the KMT2C phenotypic spectrum and reinforces the phenotypic overlap with Kleefstra syndrome and other related ID disorders. To elucidate the common molecular basis of the neuropathology associated with mutations in KMT2C and EHMT1, we characterized the role of the Drosophila KMT2C ortholog, trithorax related (trr), in the nervous system. Similar to the Drosophila EHMT1 ortholog, G9a, trr is required in the mushroom body for short term memory. Trr ChIP-seq identified 3371 binding sites, mainly in the promoter of genes involved in neuronal processes. Transcriptional profiling of pan-neuronal trr knockdown and G9a null mutant fly heads identified 613 and 1123 misregulated genes, respectively. These gene sets show a significant overlap and are associated with nearly identical gene ontology enrichments. The majority of the observed biological convergence is derived from predicted indirect target genes. However, trr and G9a also have common direct targets, including the Drosophila ortholog of Arc (Arc1), a key regulator of synaptic plasticity. Our data highlight the clinical and molecular convergence between the KMT2 and EHMT protein families, which may contribute to a molecular network underlying a larger group of ID/ASD-related disorders.",.trr,,,,,,,,,

When ±1 was mixed with AgSbF6, the dicationic Lewis acid [(±)-p-cymeneRu(H2O)(BINPO)](SbF6)2 (±2) was generated. The additions of a number of chiral poisons (P* = enantiopure ligand) were found to deactivate one of the enantiomers of the catalyst with varied levels of selectivity. The most effective chiral poison was either l-proline or l-prolinamide. In catalytic trials with l-proline, an ee of up to 54% was observed. In the case where a stoichiometric amount of (±)-Ru/methacrolein reacted in the presence of l-prolinamide, the DA product was obtained with ee = 60% (S), de = 96% (exo), and 92% conversion.",.binpos,,,,,,,,,

Resolution of racemic 1c and 1d was achieved through fractional crystallization of their diastereomeric adducts with optically active dibenzoyl tartaric acids, followed by alkaline decomplexation of the diastereomerically pure salts. Their trichlorosilane reduction gave enantiopure phosphines (+)- and (−)-(1a) (N-Me-2-BINP) and (+)- and (−)-(1b) (N-MOM-2-BINP). The electrochemical oxidative potential of 1a and 1b was found to be 0.52 and 0.60 V, respectively. Both the enantiomers of (1a) were tested as ligands of Ru(II) in asymmetric hydrogenation reactions of α- and β-oxoesters. Reactions were found to be outstandingly fast and enantioselection quite good. Comparative kinetic experiments on the hydrogenation reaction of methyl acetoacetate carried out with 1a, 1c, BINAP, and other biheteroaromatic diphosphines as ligands of Ru(II) demonstrated that all the reactions follow a first-order kinetic. A linear relationship was found between the kinetic constant log and the electrochemical oxidative potential of the diphosphine ligand.",.binpos,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have found extreme temperature can increase the risk of mortality. However, it is not clear whether extreme diurnal temperature range (DTR) is associated with daily disease-specific mortality, and how season might modify any association.
Objectives
To better understand the acute effect of DTR on mortality and identify whether season is a modifier of the DTR effect.
Methods
The distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the non-linear and delayed effects of DTR on deaths (non-accidental mortality (NAD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease (RD) and cerebrovascular disease (CBD)) in the full year, the cold season and the warm season.
Results
A non-linear relationship was consistently found between extreme DTR and mortality. Immediate effects of extreme low DTR on all types of mortality were stronger than those of extreme high DTR in the full year. The cumulative effects of extreme DTRs increased with the increment of lag days for all types of mortality in cold season, and they were greater for extreme high DTRs than those of extreme low DTRs. In hot season, the cumulative effects for extreme low DTRs increased with the increment of lag days, but for extreme high DTR they reached maxima at a lag of 13 days for all types of mortality except for CBD(at lag6 days), and then decreased.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that extreme DTR is an independent risk factor of daily mortality, and season is a modifier of the association of DTR with daily mortality.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

Dengue infections are climate sensitive, so it is important to better understand how changing climate factors affect the potential for geographic spread and future dengue epidemics. Vectorial capacity (VC) describes a vector's propensity to transmit dengue taking into account human, virus, and vector interactions. VC is highly temperature dependent, but most dengue models only take mean temperature values into account. Recent evidence shows that diurnal temperature range (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behavior of the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we used relative VC to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP) based on the temperature and DTR dependence of the parameters of A. aegypti. We found a strong temperature dependence of DEP; it peaked at a mean temperature of 29.3°C when DTR was 0°C and at 20°C when DTR was 20°C. Increasing average temperatures up to 29°C led to an increased DEP, but temperatures above 29°C reduced DEP. In tropical areas where the mean temperatures are close to 29°C, a small DTR increased DEP while a large DTR reduced it. In cold to temperate or extremely hot climates where the mean temperatures are far from 29°C, increasing DTR was associated with increasing DEP. Incorporating these findings using historical and predicted temperature and DTR over a two hundred year period (1901–2099), we found an increasing trend of global DEP in temperate regions. Small increases in DEP were observed over the last 100 years and large increases are expected by the end of this century in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions using climate change projections. These findings illustrate the importance of including DTR when mapping DEP based on VC.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

Here, we determined whether field relevant variation in environmental temperature could also modulate this relationship. Anopheles stephensi were challenged with three densities of P. falciparum gametocytes spanning a ~10-fold gradient, and housed under diurnal/daily temperature range (“DTR”) of 9°C (+5°C and −4°C) around means of 20, 24, and 28°C. Vector competence was quantified as the proportion of mosquitoes infected with oocysts in the midguts (oocyst rates) or infectious with sporozoites in the salivary glands (sporozoite rates) at peak periods of infection for each temperature to account for the differences in development rates. In addition, oocyst intensities were also recorded from infected midguts and the overall study replicated across three separate parasite cultures and mosquito cohorts. While vector competence was similar at 20 DTR 9°C and 24 DTR 9°C, oocyst and sporozoite rates were also comparable, with evidence, surprisingly, for higher vector competence in mosquitoes challenged with intermediate gametocyte densities. For the same gametocyte densities however, severe reductions in the sporozoite rates was accompanied by a significant decline in overall vector competence at 28 DTR 9°C, with gametocyte density per se showing a positive and linear effect at this temperature. Unlike vector competence, oocyst intensities decreased with increasing temperatures with a predominantly positive and linear association with gametocyte density, especially at 28 DTR 9°C. Oocyst intensities across individual infected midguts suggested temperature-specific differences in mosquito susceptibility/resistance: at 20 DTR 9°C and 24 DTR 9°C, dispersion (aggregation) increased in a density-dependent manner but not at 28 DTR 9°C where the distributions were consistently random. Limitations notwithstanding, our results suggest that variation in temperature could modify seasonal dynamics of infectious reservoirs with implications for the design and deployment of transmission-blocking vaccines/drugs.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

Unlike vector competence, oocyst intensities decreased with increasing temperatures with a predominantly positive and linear association with gametocyte density, especially at 28 DTR 9°C. Oocyst intensities across individual infected midguts suggested temperature-specific differences in mosquito susceptibility/resistance: at 20 DTR 9°C and 24 DTR 9°C, dispersion (aggregation) increased in a density-dependent manner but not at 28 DTR 9°C where the distributions were consistently random.

Unlike vector competence, oocyst intensities decreased with increasing temperatures with a predominantly positive and linear association with gametocyte density, especially at 28 DTR 9°C. Oocyst intensities across individual infected midguts suggested temperature-specific differences in mosquito susceptibility/resistance: at 20 DTR 9°C and 24 DTR 9°C, dispersion (aggregation) increased in a density-dependent manner but not at 28 DTR 9°C where the distributions were consistently random. Limitations notwithstanding, our results suggest that variation in temperature could modify seasonal dynamics of infectious reservoirs with implications for the design and deployment of transmission-blocking vaccines/drugs.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

Diphtheria toxin (DT) is a cytotoxic protein that leaves mouse cells relatively unaffected, but upon binding to hDTR it ultimately leads to cell death. We used a podocyte-specific hDTR expressing (Pod-DTR) mouse to assess the anti-permeability and cyto-protective effects of the splice isoform vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A165b). Methods: The Pod-DTR mouse was crossed with a mouse that over-expressed VEGF-A165b specifically in the podocytes (Neph-VEGF-A165b). Wild type (WT), Pod-DTR, Neph-VEGF-A165b and Pod-DTR X Neph-VEGF-A165b mice were treated with several doses of DT (1, 5, 100, and 1,000 ng/g bodyweight). Urine was collected and the glomerular water permeability (LpA/Vi) was measured ex vivo after 14 days. Structural analysis and podocyte marker expression were also assessed. Results: Pod-DTR mice developed an increased glomerular LpA/Vi 14 days after administration of DT (all doses), which was prevented when the mice over-expressed VEGF-A165b. No major structural abnormalities, podocyte ablation or albuminuria was observed in Pod-DTR mice, indicating this to be a mild model of podocyte disease. However, a change in expression and localisation of nephrin within the podocytes was observed, indicating disruption of the slit diaphragm in the Pod-DTR mice. This was prevented in the Pod-DTR X Neph-VEGF-A165b mice. Conclusion: Although only a mild model of podocyte injury, over-expression of the anti-permeability VEGF-A165b isoform in the podocytes of Pod-DTR mice had a protective effect. Therefore, this study further highlights the therapeutic potential of VEGF-A165b in glomerular disease.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

The goal is to accommodate heterogeneity among patients and find the DTR which will produce the best long-term outcome if implemented. We introduce two new statistical learning methods for estimating the optimal DTR, termed backward outcome weighted learning (BOWL), and simultaneous outcome weighted learning (SOWL). These approaches convert individualized treatment selection into an either sequential or simultaneous classification problem, and can thus be applied by modifying existing machine learning techniques. The proposed methods are based on directly maximizing over all DTRs a nonparametric estimator of the expected long-term outcome; this is fundamentally different than regression-based methods, for example, Q-learning, which indirectly attempt such maximization and rely heavily on the correctness of postulated regression models.
We prove that the resulting rules are consistent, and provide finite sample bounds for the errors using the estimated rules. Simulation results suggest the proposed methods produce superior DTRs compared with Q-learning especially in small samples. We illustrate the methods using data from a clinical trial for smoking cessation. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.",.dtr,,,,,,,,,

Test results obtained using optical fiber measurement systems have shown that there are three main arcing phases. Initially the arc rotates at an essentially constant but low velocity, subsequently its velocity oscillates between this and much higher values, and finally the arc plasma may become diffuse in nature. Test results obtained with dielectric strength probes have indicated that a unidirectional flow of arc heated gas is generated. The flow is away from the moving contact of the interrupter so promoting good dielectric strength in this critical contact region. The combination of the optical fiber and dielectric probe results indicates two possible modes of gas pumping represented, respectively, by a fan and a piston-type action of the arc. Simplified analytical models for both modes are developed with predictions obtained showing good agreement with the experimental results. Discussion of experimental results suggests that the transition from oscillatory velocity changes to diffuse arcing represents an important parameter for scaling the geometries of future interrupters and arc heaters.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

Calculations involving the average concentrations and isotopic compositions of Pb in oceanic sediments, sea-floor basaltic rocks, and the Mariana arc volcanic rocks suggest that the sediment component must have been less than 1 percent of this source material. The Pb isotopic compositions of the Mariana arc volcanic rocks lie, within experimental error, along the trend of available Pacific Ocean basalt analyses in versus 207Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb versus 206Pb/204Pb diagrams. Isotopic analyses of Pb in Pacific Ocean sediments do not lie along this trend; they have higher 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb values for comparable 206Pb/204Pb ratios. Clayey sediments generally have higher 208Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb ratios than biogenic oozes regardless of the age of the sediment. Comparison of combined Sr and Pb isotopic analyses for (1) mantle-derived materials erupted through oceanic crust, (2) altered ocean-floor basaltic rocks, and (3) volcanic rocks from oceanic island arcs suggests that the Mariana arc volcanic rocks were derived, at least in part, from altered Pacific lithosphere subducted beneath the Mariana arc. Unaltered basalts from the Mariana inter-arc basin (Mariana Trough) have Pb and Sr isotopic compositions that are very similar to those reported for some Hawaiian volcanic rocks but distinct from Mariana active and frontal arc compositions. These observations, in addition to existing major-and trace-element data, support a mantle origin for the interarc basin volcanic rocks. Dacites dredged from the Mariana remnant arc (South Honshu Ridge) have Pb isotopic compositions that are within experimental error of the active-arc analyses, consistent with a genetic relation.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

The mineralization was proved to be of hydrothermal and/or hydrogenic genesis. The former is produced by hydrothermal Fe and Mn oxi-hydroxides that cement volcanic-terrigenous material in sediments. Some Fe oxyhydroxides can be derived via the halmyrolysis of volcaniclastic material. Crusts of this stage are characterized by fairly low concentrations of trace and rare elements, and their REE composition is inherited from the volcanic-terrigenous material. The minerals of the Mn oxyhydroxides are todorokite and ""Ca-birnessite"". The Mn/Fe ratio increases away from the discharge sites of the hydrothermal solutions. The hydrogenic Fe-Mn crusts are characterized by high concentrations of trace and minor elements of both the Mn group (Co, Ni, Tl, and Mo) and the Fe group (REE, Y, and Th). The hydrogenic crusts consist of Fe-vernadite and Mn-feroxyhyte. Some of the hydrothermal crusts originally had a hydrothermal genesis. The first data were obtained on crust B30-72-10 from the Macauley Seamount in the Kermadec island arc, which contained anomalously high concentrations of Co (2587 ppm) and other Mn-related trace elements in the absence of hydrogeneous Fe oxyhydroxides.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

These data were obtained by Pacific Oceanological Institute during the 33-rd cruise of R/V Professor Bogorov in 1990. The Amirante Arc represents a seamount chain, which has submeridional strike and total length about 400 km. To the west of the Amirante Arc there are a deep sea trench and a back-arc basin, i.e. this area is characterized by structural elements associated with the subduction zone of Western Pacific type. According to our data the Amirante Arc is composed by tholeiites of ocean plateau type. This facts are evidences that the Amirante Arc differs from typical Pacific island arcs. This gives an opportunity to distinguish a special type of oceanic structures, i.e. non-volcanic (amagmatic) ridges. The Amirante Ridge has been probably formed as a result of oceanic crust heaping due to horizontal displacements of its blocks in the process of spreding ridge formation in the Indian Ocean during Cretaceous-Paleogene.

The purpose is to compare the reflective properties of a circular arc plate with those for a submerged, circular cylinder in order to assess the suitability of using circular arc plates when constructing a water wave lens. Linear theory is assumed and two separate techniques are used to determine the wave field. The first involves expanding the potential as a series of multipole potentials outside a circular region and a series of nonsingular solutions of Laplace's equation within the region and matching the expansions on the boundary. The second technique is based on a variational procedure and is used to derive an explicit, approximate expression for the reflection coefficient, under the assumption that the plate is short compared with the other length scales in the problem. Results are presented which compare the approximate solution with the full numerical method for a variety of plates. Finally, the full numerical calculations of the reflection and transmission coefficients for a plate are compared with those for a submerged, circular cylinder.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

Dormancy breaking, a prerequisite to germination completion, can be induced by different treatments though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Thus, we investigated the consequence of such treatments on the seed proteome. Two unrelated dormancy-releasing treatments were applied to dormant seeds, namely, cold stratification and exogenous nitrates, in combination with differential proteomic tools to highlight the specificities of the imbibed dormant state. The results reveal that both treatments lead to highly similar proteome adjustments. In the imbibed dormant state, enzymes involved in reserve mobilization are less accumulated and it appears that several energetically costly processes associated to seed germination and preparation for subsequent seedling establishment are repressed. Our data suggest that dormancy maintenance is associated to an abscisic-acid-dependent recapitulation of the late maturation program resulting in a higher potential to cope with environmental stresses. The comparison of the present results with previously published -omic data sets reinforces and extends the assumption that post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulations are determinant for seed germination.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have shown that sAPPα enhances cell-surface expression of glutamate receptors. Activity-related cytoskeletal-associated protein Arc (Arg3.1) is an immediate early gene capable of modulating long-term potentiation, long-term depression and homeostatic plasticity through regulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor localization. Accordingly, we hypothesized that sAPPα may enhance synaptic plasticity, in part, by the de novo synthesis of Arc. Using primary cortical and hippocampal neuronal cultures we found that sAPPα (1 nM, 2 h) enhances levels of Arc mRNA and protein. Arc protein levels were increased in both the neuronal somata and dendrites in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent manner. Additionally, dendritic Arc expression was dependent upon activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and protein kinase G. The enhancement of dendritic Arc protein was significantly reduced by antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors, and fully eliminated by dual application of these antagonists. This effect was further corroborated in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices. These data suggest sAPPα-regulated plasticity within hippocampal neurons is mediated by cooperation of NMDA and α7nACh receptors to engage a cascade of signal transduction molecules to enhance the transcription and translation of Arc.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

Arc mRNA is rapidly induced by synaptic activation and a portion is locally translated in dendrites where it modulates synaptic strength. Being an activity-dependent effector of homeostatic balance, regulation of Arc is uniquely tuned to result in short-lived bursts of expression. Cis-Acting elements that control its transitory expression post-transcriptionally reside primarily in Arc mRNA 3′ UTR. These include two conserved introns which distinctively modulate Arc mRNA stability by targeting it for destruction via the nonsense mediated decay pathway. Here, we further investigated how splicing of the Arc mRNA 3′ UTR region contributes to modulate Arc expression in cultured neurons. Unexpectedly, upon induction with brain derived neurotrophic factor, translational efficiency of a luciferase reporter construct harboring Arc 3′ UTR is significantly upregulated and this effect is dependent on splicing of Arc introns. We find that, eIF2α dephosphorylation, mTOR, ERK, PKC, and PKA activity are key to this process. Additionally, CREB-dependent transcription is required to couple Arc 3′ UTR-splicing to its translational upregulation, suggesting the involvement of de novo transcribed trans-acting factors. Overall, splicing of Arc 3′ UTR exerts a dual and unique effect in fine-tuning Arc expression upon synaptic signaling: while inducing mRNA decay to limit the time window of Arc expression, it also elicits translation of the decaying mRNA. This antagonistic effect likely contributes to the achievement of a confined yet efficient burst of Arc protein expression, facilitating its role as an effector of synapse-specific plasticity.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

Dormancy breaking, a prerequisite to germination completion, can be induced by different treatments though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Thus, we investigated the consequence of such treatments on the seed proteome. Two unrelated dormancy-releasing treatments were applied to dormant seeds, namely, cold stratification and exogenous nitrates, in combination with differential proteomic tools to highlight the specificities of the imbibed dormant state. The results reveal that both treatments lead to highly similar proteome adjustments. In the imbibed dormant state, enzymes involved in reserve mobilization are less accumulated and it appears that several energetically costly processes associated to seed germination and preparation for subsequent seedling establishment are repressed. Our data suggest that dormancy maintenance is associated to an abscisic-acid-dependent recapitulation of the late maturation program resulting in a higher potential to cope with environmental stresses. The comparison of the present results with previously published -omic data sets reinforces and extends the assumption that post-transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulations are determinant for seed germination.",.arc,,,,,,,,,

As thermoresponsive nanogels (tNGs) are capable of enhancing penetration through biological barriers such as the stratum corneum and are taken up by keratinocytes of human skin, potential adverse consequences of their exposure must be elucidated. In this study, tNGs were synthesized from dendritic polyglycerol (dPG) and two thermoresponsive polymers. tNG_dPG_tPG are the combination of dPG with poly(glycidyl methyl ether-co-ethyl glycidyl ether) (p(GME-co-EGE)) and tNG_dPG_pNIPAM the one with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM). Both thermoresponsive nanogels are able to incorporate high amounts of dexamethasone and tacrolimus, drugs used in the treatment of severe skin diseases. Cellular uptake, intracellular localization and the toxicological properties of the tNGs were comprehensively characterized in primary normal human keratinocytes (NHK) and in spontaneously transformed aneuploid immortal keratinocyte cell line from adult human skin (HaCaT). Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed fluorescently labeled tNGs entered into the cells and localized predominantly within lysosomal compartments. MTT assay, comet assay and carboxy-H2DCFDA assay, demonstrated neither cytotoxic or genotoxic effects, nor any induction of reactive oxygen species of the tNGs in keratinocytes. In addition, both tNGs were devoid of eye irritation potential as shown by bovine corneal opacity and permeability (BCOP) test and red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis assay. Therefore, our study provides evidence that tNGs are locally well tolerated and underlines their potential for cutaneous drug delivery.",.tng,,,,,,,,,

At K3 the Australian languages emerge as a solid cluster (Pale Green) within the non-AN group of K2. At K4 the AN languages are differentiated into a group which is basically the Oceanic subgroup (Pale Blue), and the remainder of western AN (Dark Green). The Oceanic languages of the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, and Polynesia exhibit a considerable contribution from western AN as well. At K5 the Papuan languages are split into TNG (Dark Blue) and non-TNG (Pink), with some non-TNG of eastern Indonesia and New Britain showing admixture from AN clusters. At K6 a new cluster (Red) emerges, containing the Papuan languages of the Bird's Head and island Indonesia, as well as the non-TNG languages of the Bismarck archipelago. In addition, the AN languages Taba and Biak of eastern Indonesia exhibit a major contribution from this population. Some contribution is also seen in Oceanic languages east of the New Guinea mainland. At K7 we find a first diversification within the Australian set, mainly coinciding with the opposition between PN (Pale Green) and various non-PN (Yellow) families. Two non-PN languages, Garrwa and Kayardild, that had been previously classified as PN but more recently recognized as non-PN (Evans 2003: 12 [7]) cluster in our analysis with recognized PN languages. K8 exhibits a new contributing population among the non-TNG languages (Orange), present mainly in what can be identified as Northwest Papuan languages, different from other northern and southern non-TNG clusters, the latter of which is more clearly delineated in K9. At K9 the South Papuan cluster (Pale Purple) appears very strong in languages of the Trans-Fly area and Yélî Dnye of Rossel Island and has a weak contribution in Inanwatan towards the west and in Bilua of the Solomon Islands in the east. It leaves a group of languages that can be identified as Northeast Papuan. At K10 a new cluster (Dark Purple) is found among the AN languages. Signals of this population are not contiguous, suggesting two different strands in the Oceanic subgroup of the AN family: (1) a New Britain Oceanic also found in Äiwoo of the Reefs-Santa Cruz group (Pale Blue), and three languages of Vanuatu (Mwotlap, South Efate, and Sye); and (2) all other Oceanic languages (Dark Purple). Interestingly, at K11 the bifurcation of Oceanic languages of K10 disappears, while a new contributing population among the non-TNG languages can be identified.

The concept of the utilization of rearranged ends for development of personalized biomarkers has attracted much attention owing to its clinical applicability. Although targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for recurrent rearrangements has been successful in hematologic malignancies, its application to solid tumors is problematic due to the paucity of recurrent translocations. However, copy-number breakpoints (CNBs), which are abundant in solid tumors, can be utilized for identification of rearranged ends.
Method
As a proof of concept, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing at copy-number breakpoints (TNGS-CNB) in nine colon cancer cases including seven primary cancers and two cell lines, COLO205 and SW620. For deduction of CNBs, we developed a novel competitive single-nucleotide polymorphism (cSNP) microarray method entailing CNB-region refinement by competitor DNA.
Result
Using TNGS-CNB, 19 specific rearrangements out of 91 CNBs (20.9%) were identified, and two polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplifiable rearrangements were obtained in six cases (66.7%). And significantly, TNGS-CNB, with its high positive identification rate (82.6%) of PCR-amplifiable rearrangements at candidate sites (19/23), just from filtering of aligned sequences, requires little effort for validation.

Expression of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, VNP and GFP proteins in Nd, E14tg2a and TNG-A cells, grown in serum/LIF or 2i media, and measured by IF, FC-IS or FC in non-fixed cells. Averages and standard deviations of at least 3 independent experiments are depicted (except for TNG-A cells, where only two biological replicates were performed). Nanog expression is not statistically different between different cell lines grown in the same media, although IF measurements provide slightly lower values than FC-IS, probably due to higher sensitivity of cytometry analysis. ES cells grown in 2i media significantly increase Nanog expression (determined by FC-IS) when compared to serum/LIF conditions for all cell lines. In Nd cells, VNP mimics Nanog expression in both culture conditions. In contrast, the percentage of GFP-positive cells in TNG-A ES cells is much higher than the percentage of Nanog-positive cells in serum/LIF conditions, most likely due to reporter stability. Oct4 and Sox2 are always detected in more than 90% of cells in both media and for all ES cell lines, with no statistically significant differences being observed.

The hydrothermal growth process from hydrolysis of Fe3+ precursors involves three steps: the nucleation of akaganeite (β-FeOOH) nanorods, followed by the formation of goethite (α-FeOOH) crystals with acicular and twinned shapes, and a subsequent transformation into hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanoparticles. The phase transformation and growth of α-Fe2O3 particles from α-FeOOH follows dissolution of goethite and reprecipitation as hematite process. The initial nucleation of α-Fe2O3 particles was found to form epitaxially on goethite {001} surfaces due to a perfect lattice match between goethite {001} surface and hematite {001} planes. The structural relationship between goethite and hematite is G(020)//H(030) with G[100]//H[100]. The obtained α-Fe2O3 hexagonal bipyramid particles are enclosed by 12 {113} planes and six {104} facets. Since the twinned α-FeOOH particles are one of the typical shapes of intermediate goethite crystals, the nucleation of hematite particles on two twinned arms gives rise to the formation of twinned hematite particles. F– anions play an important role in the formation of α-Fe2O3 particles with a hexagonal bipyramid shape because high concentration of F– anions can stabilize the exposed {113} surfaces. The controlled synthesis of α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles with defined surfaces not only provides significant information on hematite surface structures and energies but also is critical to give the structure–property relationship for the application of hematite materials.",.tng,,,,,,,,,

In particular, I will show results from large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations like Illustris and IllustrisTNG. These numerical models return a remarkably diverse and rich set of observables (across galaxy/halo masses, galacto/ clustercentric distances, cosmic epochs, and environments) that can be contrasted to observational findings. For example, the IllustrisTNG simulations reproduce quantitatively the observed diversity, statistical and structural properties of the observed galaxy populations, primarily in terms of their stellar content within their bright innermost regions. We can therefore reliably use their output to uncover how the underlying physical processes determine the stellar-populations and phase-space properties of the baryonic components also around such galaxies, in the dim outskirts. In particular, I will give examples of how we can obtain un-observable properties of galaxies’ assembly histories from observable properties of their stellar haloes.",.tng,,,,,,,,,

The knowledge on the potential geographical distribution of E. erythropappus is therefore critical for the species sustainability. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate and map current and future ecological niche for E. erythropappus in Minas Gerais. We used the Random Forests algorithm to model the ecological niche for current and future climates scenarios. Our predictions indicate Espinhaço, Mantiqueira, and Canastra mountain ranges as core areas of distribution and forecast drastic reductions in potential areas under all climate scenarios. Based on our results, we highlight that the continual harvesting of naturally-occurring E. erythropappus populations will not be sufficient to supply the market demand. Silviculture practices would likely serve as an economically viable and ecological sustainable alternative to harvesting natural populations.",.tng,,,,,,,,,

Chronic renal disease (CRD) accelerates atherosclerosis and cardiovascular calcification. Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in patients with CRD, however, the benefits of statins on cardiovascular disease in CRD remain unclear. This study has determined the effects of pitavastatin, the newest statin, on arterial inflammation and calcification in atherogenic mice with CRD.
Methods and Results
CRD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in cholesterol-fed apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Mice were randomized into three groups: control mice, CRD mice, and CRD mice treated with pitavastatin. Ultrasonography showed that pitavastatin treatment significantly attenuated luminal stenosis in brachiocephalic arteries of CRD mice. Near-infrared molecular imaging and correlative Mac3 immunostaining demonstrated a significant reduction in macrophage accumulation in pitavastatin-treated CRD mice. Pitavastatin treatment reduced levels of osteopontin in plasma and atherosclerotic lesions in CRD mice, but did not produce a significant reduction in calcification in atherosclerotic plaques as assesses by histology. CRD mice had significantly higher levels of phosphate in plasma than did control mice, which did not change by pitavastatin. In vitro, pitavastatin suppressed the expression of osteopontin in peritoneal macrophages stimulated with phosphate or calcium/phosphate in concentrations similar to those found in human patients with CRD.
Conclusion
Our study provides in vivo evidence that pitavastatin reduces inflammation within atherosclerotic lesions in CRD mice.",.crd,,,,,,,,,

CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV. CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0.1 µg/mL in LLC-MK2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV-1, 3, and 4 efficiently. CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon. Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration device separation, as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV-2 infection. Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site. Since CRDS has already been tested in humans without serious side effects, its clinical application can be considered.",.crd,,,,,,,,,

dynamics simulations totaling 30 μs on two nascent HDLs, each with
2 APOA1 and either 160 phospholipids and 24 cholesterols or 200
phospholipids and 20 cholesterols, show that residues 1–21 of the N-
terminal domains of APOA1 interact via strong salt bridges. Residues
26–43 of one APOA1 in the smaller particle form a hinge on the disk
edge, which displaces the C-terminal domain of the other APOA1 to
the phospholipid surface. The proposed structures are supported by
chemical cross-linking, Rosetta modeling of the N-terminal domain,
and analysis of the lipid-free Δ185APOA1 crystal structure. These
structures provide a framework for understanding HDL maturation

Breeding plants that have broad-spectrum disease resistance is one of the best ways to prevent clubroot. In the present study, eight Chinese cabbage germplasms were screened using published clubroot-resistant (CR) loci-/gene-linked markers. A CR gene Crr3 potential carrier “85-74” was detected which linked to marker BRSTS61; however, “85-74” shows different responses to local pathogens “LAB-19,” “LNND-2,” and “LAB-10” from “CR-73” which harbors Crr3. We used a next-generation sequencing-based bulked segregant analysis approach combined with genetic mapping to detect CR genes in an F2 segregant population generated from a cross between the Chinese cabbage inbred lines “85-74” (CR) and “BJN3-1” (clubroot susceptible). The “85-74” line showed resistance to a local pathogen “LAB-19” which was identified as race 4; a genetic analysis revealed that the resistance was conferred by a single dominant gene. The CR gene which we named CRd was mapped to a 60 kb (1 cM) region between markers yau389 and yau376 on chromosome A03. CRd is located upstream of Crr3 which was confirmed based on the physical positions of Crr3 linked markers. The identification of CRd linked markers can be applied to marker-assisted selection in the breeding of new CR cultivars of Chinese cabbage and other Brassica crops.",.crd,,,,,,,,,

We explore the short-term response of DMS production and cycling and that of its algal precursor dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and ocean acidification (OA) in five 96 h shipboard bioassay experiments. Experiments were performed in June and July 2011, using water collected from contrasting sites in NW European waters (Outer Hebrides, Irish Sea, Bay of Biscay, North Sea). Concentrations of DMS and DMSP, alongside rates of DMSP synthesis and DMS production and consumption, were determined during all experiments for ambient CO2 and three high-CO2 treatments (550, 750, 1000 µatm). In general, the response to OA throughout this region showed little variation, despite encompassing a range of biological and biogeochemical conditions. We observed consistent and marked increases in DMS concentrations relative to ambient controls (110% (28-223%) at 550 µatm, 153% (56-295%) at 750 µatm and 225% (79-413%) at 1000 µatm), and decreases in DMSP concentrations (28% (18-40%) at 550 µatm, 44% (18-64%) at 750 µatm and 52% (24-72%) at 1000 µatm). Significant decreases in DMSP synthesis rate constants (µDMSP /d) and DMSP production rates (nmol/d) were observed in two experiments (7-90% decrease), whilst the response under high CO2 from the remaining experiments was generally indistinguishable from ambient controls. Rates of bacterial DMS gross consumption and production gave weak and inconsistent responses to high CO2. The variables and rates we report increase our understanding of the processes behind the response to OA. This could provide the opportunity to improve upon mesocosm-derived empirical modelling relationships and to move towards a mechanistic approach for predicting future DMS concentrations. In order to allow full comparability with other ocean acidification data sets, the R package seacarb (Gattuso et al, 2015) was used to compute a complete and consistent set of carbonate system variables, as described by Nisumaa et al. (2010). In this dataset the original values were archived in addition with the recalculated parameters (see related PI). The date of carbonate chemistry calculation is 2016-03-18.",.dms,,,,,,,,,

Three studies investigated hitherto undescribed complexity in the DMS spectra of methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol product ions formed from a 63Ni ionisation source. 54000 DMS spectra obtained over a concentration range of 0.01 mg m−3(g) to 1.80 g m−3(g) revealed the phenomenon of auto-modification of the product ions. This occurred when the neutral vapour concentration exceeded the level required to induce a neutral-ion collision during the low field portion of the dispersion field waveform. Further, post-ionisation cluster-ion formation or protonated monomer/proton bound dimer inter-conversion within the ion-filter was indicated by apparent shifts in the values of the protonated monomer compensation field maximum; indicative of post-ionisation conversion of the protonated monomer to a proton-bound dimer. APCI-DMS-quadrupole mass spectrometry studies enabled the ion dissociation products from dispersion-field heating to be monitored and product ion fragmentation relationships to be proposed. Methanol was not observed to dissociate, while propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol underwent dissociation reactions consistent with dehydration processes that led ultimately to the generation of what is tentatively assigned as a cyclo-C3H3+ ion (m/z 39) and hydrated protons. Studies of the interaction of ion filter temperature with dispersion-field heating of product ions isolated dissociation/fragmentation product ions that have not been previously described in DMS. The implications of these combined findings with regard to data sharing and data interpretation were highlighted.",.dms,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the effect of increasing CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) on concentrations of volatile biogenic dimethylsulfide (DMS) and its precursor dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), through monoculture studies and community pCO2 perturbation. DMS is a climatically important gas produced by many marine algae: it transfers sulfur into the atmosphere and is a major influence on biogeochemical climate regulation through breakdown to sulfate and formation of subsequent cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Overall, production of DMS and DMSP by the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi strain RCC1229 was unaffected by growth at 900 µatm pCO2, but DMSP production normalised to cell volume was 12 % lower at the higher pCO2 treatment. These cultures were compared with community DMS and DMSP production during an elevated pCO2 mesocosm experiment with the aim of studying E. huxleyi in the natural environment. Results contrasted with the culture experiments and showed reductions in community DMS and DMSP concentrations of up to 60 and 32 % respectively at pCO2 up to 3000 µatm, with changes attributed to poorer growth of DMSP-producing nanophytoplankton species, including E. huxleyi, and potentially increased microbial consumption of DMS and dissolved DMSP at higher pCO2. DMS and DMSP production differences between culture and community likely arise from pH affecting the inter-species responses between microbial producers and consumers. Dimethylsulphide (DMS), dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and a range of volatile halocarbons compounds were measured during a mesocosm experiment designed to determine the effect of elevated CO2 on a temperate spring phytoplankton community in May/ June 2011. Integrated water samples were collected daily from the full 25m of the mesocosm and the surrounding Raunefjord waters, and analysed using GC-MS for the trace gas concentrations.",.dms,,,,,,,,,

The nuclear Hessian, normal modes, and harmonic vibrational frequencies were then computed using analytical (ANFREQ) and numerical (NUMFREQ) methodologies.  The numerical Hessians were computed with nuclear (Cartesian) displacement increments ranging from 0.0001 Bohr to 0.1 Bohr.  The geometry optimization was conducted using the parameters of the TIGHTOPT simple input keyword; KS-SCF and CP-SCF calculations used VERYTIGHTSCF thresholds.
An analysis of the deviation of normal modes and harmonic frequencies for each numerical Hessian computation from the analytical Hessian results was presented as a single-figure presentation (SFP) at the 2016 Virtual Winterschool on Computational Chemistry (http://winterschool.cc). This SFP can be found at doi:10.5281/zenodo.44807.
For the initial OPT and ANFREQ, the following files are provided:
PQ_OPT_AFQ.engrad -- Gradient data
PQ_OPT_AFQ.gbw -- Wavefunction 
PQ_OPT_AFQ.hess -- Hessian data
PQ_OPT_AFQ.out -- Computation output
PQ_OPT_AFQ.trj -- Optimization trajectory (multi-frame OpenBabel XYZ)
PQ_OPT_AFQ.txt -- ORCA input file
PQ_OPT_AFQ.xyz -- Optimized geometry
For each following NUMFREQ, the following files are provided, where the number at the end of the filename indicates the nuclear displacement increment in Bohrs:
PQ_NFQ_0.####.hess -- Hessian data
PQ_NFQ_0.####.out -- Computation output
PQ_NFQ_0.####.txt -- ORCA input file
Since ORCA does not report non-mass-weighted normal modes, these are provided separately for each calculation as modes_0.####.csv (modes_A.csv for the analytical Hessian.)
The dot products of each normal mode from the numerical Hessian computations with the corresponding mode in the analytical Hessian calculation (modes ordered as presented in the ORCA output) are provided in modes_dot_products.csv. The MAD of these data are plotted in the LH figure of the above-referenced SFP.
For those numerical Hessian computations with normal modes out of sequence relative to the analytical calculation, permutation matrices to bring them back in accord with the analytical Hessian modes are included as swaps_0.####.csv.
A table of the calculated vibrational frequencies for each computation, re-ordered as necessary to bring the normal modes in accord with the analytical Hessian run, is included as freqs_swapped.csv. The MAD and maximum absolute deviation of these data are plotted in the RH figure of the above-referenced SFP.",.trj,,,,,,,,,

For example, a stimulus is repeatedly indented to repeatedly estimate its softness. Albeit such redundant estimates are equally reliable, they seem to contribute differently to the overall haptic percept in a comparison task. When comparing the softness of two silicon rubber stimuli, the within-stimulus weights of estimates of the second stimulus' softness decrease during the exploration. Here we test the hypothesis that such decrease of weights depends on the representation strength of the first stimulus’ softness. We varied the length of the first stimulus’ exploration. Participants subsequently explored two silicon rubber stimuli by indenting the first stimulus (comparison) 1 or 5 times and the second stimulus (standard) always 3 times. We assessed the weights of indentation-specific estimates from the second stimulus by manipulating perceived softness during single indentations. Our results show that the longer the first stimulus is explored
the more estimates of the second stimulus' softness can be included in the comparison of the two stimuli. This suggests that the exploration length of the first stimulus determines the strength of its representation which influences the decrease of weights of indentation-specific estimates of the second stimulus.

We investigated how covert attention affects perception of 3D objects in active touch. In our experiment, participants simultaneously explored the shape and roughness of two objects in sequence, and were told afterwards to compare the two objects with regard to one of the two features. To direct the focus of covert attention to the different features we manipulated the expectation of a shape or roughness judgment by varying the frequency of trials for each task (20%, 50%, 80%), then we measured discrimination thresholds. We found higher discrimination thresholds for both shape and roughness perception when the task was unexpected, compared to the conditions in which the task was expected (or both tasks were expected equally). Our results suggest that active touch perception is modulated by expectations about the task. This implies that despite fundamental differences, active and passive touch are affected by feature selective covert attention in a similar way.

The relative contributions of these signals to the combined percept of softness was not yet addressed directly. We transmitted subtle external vertical forces to the exploring human finger during the exploration of deformable silicone rubber stimuli to dissociate the force estimates provided by the kinesthetic signals and the efference copy from cutaneous force estimates. This manipulation introduced a conflict between the cutaneous and the kinesthetic/efference copy information on softness. We measured Points of Subjective Equality (PSE) of manipulated references to stimuli which were explored without external forces. PSEs shifted as a linear function of external force in predicted directions - to higher compliances with pushing and to lower compliances with pulling force. We found relative contribution of kinesthetic/efference copy information to perceived softness being 23% for rather hard and 29% for rather soft stimuli. Our results suggest that an integration of the kinesthetic/efference copy information and cutaneous information with constant weights underlies softness perception. The kinesthetic/efference copy information seems to be slightly more important for the perception of rather soft stimuli.

Mechanisms underlying the integration of sequentially derived estimates from one sense are less clear. Here we investigate the integration of seriallysampled redundant information in softness perception. We developed a  method to manipulate haptically perceived softness of silicone rubber stimuli during bare finger exploration. We then manipulated softness estimates derived from single movement segments (indentations) in a multi-segmented exploration to assess their  contributions to the overall percept. Participants explored two stimuli in sequence, using 2-5 indentations and reported which stimulus felt softer. Estimates of the first stimulus' softness contributed to the judgments similarly, whereas for the second stimulus  estimates from later as compared to earlier indentations contributed less. In line with unequal weighting, the percept""s reliability  increased with increasing exploration length less than predicted by the MLE model. This pattern of results is well explained by  assuming that the representation of the first stimulus fades when the second stimulus is explored, which fits with a   neurophysiological model of perceptual decisions (Deco et al., 2010).

We studied the effect of adaptation in haptic softness perception. Participants compared two silicon rubber stimuli, a reference and a comparison stimulus, by indenting them simultaneously with the index fingers of their two hands and decided which one felt softer. In adaptation conditions the index finger that explored the  reference stimulus had previously been adapted to another rubber stimulus. The adaptation stimulus was indented 5 times with a force of >15N, thus the two in-dex fingers had a different sensory past. In baseline conditions there was no previous adaptation. We measured the Points of Subjective Equality (PSEs) of one reference stimulus to a set of comparison stimuli. We used four different adaptation stimuli, one was harder, two were softer and one had approximately the same compliance as compared to the reference stimulus. PSEs shifted as a function of the compliance of the adaptation stimulus: the reference was per-ceived to be softer when the finger had been adapted to a harder stimulus and it was perceived to be harder after adaptation to a softer stimulus. We conclude that recent sensory experience causes a shift of haptically perceived softness away from the softness of the adaptation stimulus. The finding that perceived softness is susceptible to adaptation suggests that there might be neural chan-nels tuned to different softness values and softness is an independent primary perceptual quality.

498,Improving the GP Referral Process to an ENT Outpatient Clinic,"['by Kellie Nwaokorie', 'Kellie Nwaokorie', 'Kellie Nwaokorie']",['Uncategorized'],['IR content'],"In the Health Service Executive the general practitioner (GP) acts as an arbitrator to secondary specialist care. The patient referral is a key aspect of the GP role. The referral involves a transfer of clinical responsibility between professionals; however, the current Irish process is variable and unsustainable. There is an inconsistency of information in referrals directed to the Otolaryngology (ENT) department of a teaching hospital in Dublin. This Quality Improvement (QI) project plan centres on improving the GP referral process to an ENT outpatient clinic. The intent is to provide GPs with an explicit referral pathway for the most commonly referred presenting complaints. Consequently, creating a standardised referral process, and, over time, decrease the long outpatient waitlist. Adopting specific QI tools, including a driver diagram and process flow map, the factors contributing to unnecessary referrals were identified. The data collected identified the five most commonly referred ENT conditions: Sinusitis (21.8%), Tonsillitis (21.1%), Hearing Loss (20.7%), Tinnitus (20.1%) and Swallow Disturbance (16.1%). A sample of 51 referrals were benchmarked against the national standard referral form and graded to a maximum of 39 points. The results exhibited that 47% were eReferral and 53% were paper, achieving average scores of 23.8 and 19, consecutively. In total 92% of referrals were deemed ‘inappropriate’. A concise GP guideline titled ‘The Top Five’ was created for implementation and consists of clear, supportable ENT referral guidance. The intent is to provide a structured GP ENT referral and management pathway for patients depending on their clinical need.",.ent,,,,,,,,,
499,Reducing the Waiting List for New Referrals to the ENT Outpatient Department,"['by Jana Crowley', 'Jana Crowley', 'Jana Crowley']",['Uncategorized'],['IR content'],"Lengthy outpatient waiting lists are a global healthcare concern affecting most hospital specialities, including in Ireland. The result is a delay in treatment and suboptimal outcomes for newly referred patients. Simultaneously, patients requiring long-term follow-up care exist amid this overburdened system. Data collection showed that in December 2017, 3,944 patients were waiting for a first time appointment within the ENT service of a large urban teaching hospital in Dublin. Of these, 766 were waiting to be seen by just one consultant and a total of 399 were waiting for more than 52 weeks. Of the 882 patients who were seen by the consultant between January and December 2017, only 252 were new referrals. These figures highlight the large proportion of return patients attending ENT outpatient services. This quality improvement project plan concentrates on an effort to improve waiting times for new patients by the creation of a non-physician-led ‘microsuction clinic’, which aims to streamline patients requiring regular care within the ENT department. Quality improvement tools including a driver diagram and an Ishikawa diagram were used to establish the root of the problem. With guidance of the DMAIC framework, the anticipated result could be a 46% reduction in the number of patients waiting more than twelve months, within one year of the projects implementation. Simultaneously, return patients could benefit from improved continuity of care and faster access to outpatient follow-up appointments.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

Using analytical ultracentrifugation, we found that EntA undergoes concentration-dependent dimer−tetramer self-association (KD = 12.3 μM). We further found that EntA can form a specific complex with EntE. Pull-down assays revealed that recombinant EntA bait pulled down EntE from E. coli lysates, whereas recombinant EntE bait could pull down EntA. Addition of the SMCC cross-linker to a mixture of EntA and EntE resulted in a cross-linked product with a molecular mass of >250 kDa, suggesting a complex stoichiometry of one EntA tetramer and four EntE monomers. The effect of EntA on EntE activity was also examined. Addition of a 4-fold excess of EntA to an EntE assay mixture resulted in a 6-fold stimulation of EntE activity. EntA was also found to perturb the FRET signal between EntE donor residues and EntE-bound DHB. By following the EntA-dependent decrease in the magnitude of the EntE−DHB FRET signal, EntA−EntE binding behavior was found to be sigmoidal, suggesting the presence of both low- and high-affinity binding sites. The EntA−EntE interaction was also directly measured by isothermal titration calorimetry at 10 °C. The resulting binding isotherm fit well to a model describing two binding sites, supporting our AUC and fluorescence data. Taken together, our data show that tetrameric EntA optimally interacts with EntE, resulting in an enhancement of EntE activity.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

ENT is used as an exosiderophore by Pseudomonas aeruginosa with transport of ferri-ENT across the outer membrane by the PfeA transporter. Next to the pfeA gene on the chromosome is localized a gene encoding for an esterase, PfeE, whose transcription is regulated, as for pfeA, by the presence of ENT in bacterial environment. Purified PfeE hydrolyzed ferri-ENT into three molecules of 2,3-DHBS (2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine) still complexed with ferric iron, and complete dissociation of iron from ENT chelating groups was only possible in the presence of both PfeE and an iron reducer, such as DTT. The crystal structure of PfeE and an inactive PfeE mutant complexed with ferri-ENT or a nonhydrolyzable ferri-catechol complex allowed identification of the enzyme binding site and the catalytic triad. Finally, cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy showed periplasmic localization of PfeE in P. aeruginosa cells. Thus, the molecular mechanism of iron dissociation from ENT in P. aeruginosa differs from that previously described in E. coli. In P. aeruginosa, siderophore hydrolysis occurs in the periplasm, with ENT never reaching the bacterial cytoplasm. In E. coli, ferri-ENT crosses the inner membrane via the ABC transporter FepBCD and ferri-ENT is hydrolyzed by the esterase Fes only once it is in the cytoplasm.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

This paper demonstrates a relayed EnT mechanism that accelerates the migration of NIR excitons between PbS QDs by a factor of 20 from that of one-step EnT through a polyelectrolyte and even a factor of ∼2 from that of one-step EnT between QDs in direct contact, by employing a J-aggregate (J-agg) of a cyanine dye as an exciton bridge. The donor QDs, acceptor QDs, and J-agg are electrostatically assembled into a sandwich structure with layer-by-layer deposition. Estimates of EnT rate and yield from transient and steady-state absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies show that the rate-limiting step in the relay is EnT from the donor QD to the J-agg, while EnT from the J-agg to the acceptor QD occurs in <10 ps. A comparison of this system to the analogous solution-phase system suggests that the overall donor-to-acceptor EnT yield in the relay (18%) can be improved by depositing the J-agg with more intermolecular order. This work demonstrates the viability of relayed EnT through a molecular bridge as a strategy for accelerating long-distance exciton migration in assemblies of QDs, in particular in the near-infrared.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible effects of glucosylation and macrolactone hydrolysis on the physical properties of Ent, the membrane affinities and iron acquisition rates of Ent and Ent-derived siderophores were measured. The data obtained indicate that Ent has a high membrane affinity (Kx = 1.5 × 104) similar to that of ferric acinetoferrin, an amphiphile containing two eight-carbon hydrophobic chains. Glucosylation and macrolactone hydrolysis decrease the membrane affinity of Ent by 5–25-fold. Furthermore, in the presence of phospholipid vesicles, the iron acquisition rate is significantly increased by glucosylation and macrolactone hydrolysis, due to the resultant decrease in membrane sequestration of the siderophore.

The aza analogues inhibited recombinant ent-kaurene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (GST-rAtKS) with inhibition constants (IC50 = 1 × 10-7 and 1 × 10-6 M) similar in magnitude to the pseudo-binding constant of the bicyclic ent-copalyl diphosphate substrate (Km = 3 × 10-7 M). Large enhancements of binding affinities (IC50 = 4 × 10-9 and 2 × 10-8 M) were observed in the presence of 1 mM pyrophosphate, which is consistent with a tightly bound ent-beyeranyl+/pyrophosphate- ion pair intermediate in the cyclization−rearrangement catalyzed by this diterpene synthase. The weak inhibition (IC50 = 1 × 10-5 M) exhibited by ent-beyeran-16-exo-yl diphosphate (11) and its failure to undergo bridge rearrangement to kaurene appear to rule out the covalent diphosphate as a free intermediate. 16-Aza-ent-beyerane is proposed as an effective mimic for the ent-beyeran-16-yl carbocation with potential applications as an active site probe for the various ent-diterpene cyclases and as a novel, selective inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis in plants.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

Human cells release the innate immune protein siderocalin (Scn, also known as lipocalin-2/Lcn2, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/NGAL) that can inhibit bacterial growth by sequestering iron in a ferric complex with enterobactin (Ent), the ubiquitous Escherichia coli siderophore. Pathogenic E. coli use the virulence-associated esterase IroE to linearize the Ent cyclic trilactone to linear enterobactin (lin-Ent). We characterized lin-Ent interactions with Scn by using native mass spectrometry (MS) with hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) and Lys/Arg specific covalent footprinting. These approaches support 1:1 binding of both Fe­(III)-lin-Ent to Scn and iron-free lin-Ent to Scn. Both ferric and nonferric lin-Ent localize to all three pockets of the Scn calyx, consistent with Scn capture of lin-Ent both before and after Fe­(III) chelation. These findings raise the possibility that Scn neutralizes both siderophores and siderophore-bound iron during infections. This integrated, MS-based approach circumvents the limitations that frustrate traditional structural approaches to examining Scn interactions with enterobactin-based ligands.",.ent,,,,,,,,,

For use in high-top models, an extrapolation of the dataset up to ~0.01 hPa or higher, may be required. The UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) has produced an updated/extended version of the SPARC ozone dataset. The following were done: (1) A multiple-linear regression is performed on the historical raw pressure-level data between 1000-1 hPa consistent with the Randal and Wu method used to construct the timeseries. The ozone is then represented as: O3(t) = a*SOL + b*EESC + seasonal_cycle + residuals. For consistency, the 11-yr solar cycle and EESC indices are identical to those used to prepare the original dataset. NOTE: the SOLAR index is a 180.5nm timeseries provided by Fei Wu at NCAR. (2) The seasonal cycle and residual fields are extrapolated and reduced above 1 hPa using O3(z)=O3(1hPa)*exp(-(z-z(1hPa))/H). Where H = 7 km. The seasonal cycle field is then used to provide a smooth climatology of ozone up to the model top. It has also been smoothed in latitude to the poles with a cosine function. (3) To minimize the 11-yr solar cycle and trend components in the mesosphere the a and b regression coefficients are extrapolated and reduced above 1 hPa twice as rapidly as the seasonal cycle, i.e. using the same method but with H = 3.5 km. (4) The full ozone timeseries is then reconstructed using the equation from (1). The ozone climatologies are not affected. (5) The standard SPARC ozone dataset which extends into the future does not include solar cycle variability post-2009. For production of a dataset extending into the future including an 11-yr ozone solar cycle, the solar regression index is used to build a future time series consistent with a repeating solar irradiance compiled by the UK Met Office and is modelled as a sinusoid with a period of 11 years, with mean and max-min values corresponding to solar cycle 23 (Gareth Jones, pers. comm.).",.ncdf,,,,,,,,,
